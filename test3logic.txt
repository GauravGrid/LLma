The code in this folder deals with various aspects of customer and pricing data management, including:

- Rebate code handling - converting old rebate codes to new codes, linking customers to rebate codes, producing outputs for research and auditing (HSHI12.txt)

- Customer master data updates - updating customer numbers and branch codes, deleting and recreating customer number records (HSHI17.txt) 

- Pricing and discounts - looking up pricing, discounts, surcharges, etc. based on customer, product, quantity, and other criteria (HS0095.txt)

- Account master updates - converting account types, updating associated G/L accounts (HSHI_KL.txt) 

- Sales data integration - transferring sales data from Excel to CSV, merging into a database file (HSHI_ESZ.txt)

The core themes are:

- Master data management - updating critical master data like customer records, accounts, pricing

- Sales integration - bringing in external sales data and merging into databases

- Rebate processing - converting rebate codes and linking to customers

- Pricing/discount logic - applying pricing rules and discounts 

- Reporting/auditing - generating outputs for research, auditing, debugging 

- Data validation - type checking, error handling, duplicate checking

Key files used include customer masters, account ledgers, sales orders, pricing tables, and rebate codes.

The programs focus on batch processing and data integration. There is some interactivity via displays and subfiles. But core logic is file-based processing, merging data sources, master data management.
