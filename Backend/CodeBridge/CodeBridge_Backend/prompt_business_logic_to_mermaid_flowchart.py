        1. Data Sources- The query retrieves data from three main tables: `products`, `order_items`, and `product_categories`. These tables likely represent products, individual sales transactions, and product categories, respectively.
        2. Product Metrics- For each product, the query calculates the average unit price (`avg_price`), total quantity sold (`total_quantity_sold`), and total revenue (`total_revenue`) generated from all sales.
        3. Grouping- The results are grouped by product category (`category_name`) and product name (`product_name`). This grouping allows us to see how products in each category are performing.
        4. Filtering (HAVING clause)- To focus on significant product performance, the query filters out products with total revenue less than or equal to $10,000. This helps identify products that are contributing substantially to revenue.
        5. Sorting (ORDER BY clause)- The final result set is sorted first by product category in ascending order (`pc.category_name`) and then by total revenue in descending order (`total_revenue DESC`). This arrangement provides a clear view of how products within each category rank in terms of revenue generation.
        Overall, this SQL code is designed to provide a meaningful analysis of product performance within different categories, highlighting top-performing products that have generated significant revenue, while also showing average pricing and quantity sold. This information can be valuable for strategic business decisions, inventory management, and marketing efforts.

        The provided code appears to be an aggregation pipeline for querying and aggregating data from a MongoDB database, likely related to orders, products, and product categories.
        Here's a breakdown of the business logic behind this code:
        1. $lookup Stages (Joins): The code starts by performing two `$lookup` stages. These stages essentially perform left outer joins between the `orders` collection and 
        the `products` collection, as well as between the `products` collection and the `product_categories` collection. It links documents based on common fields 
        (`product_id` and `category_id`) to combine data from different collections into a single document.
        2. $unwind Stages: After the `$lookup` stages, the `$unwind` stages are used to deconstruct the arrays created by the `$lookup` operations. This is done to flatten the 
        arrays and work with individual documents for further processing.
        3. $group Stage: The `$group` stage groups the documents by a composite key, consisting of `category_name` from the `product_categories` collection and `product_name`
        from the `products` collection. This step effectively groups orders by product categories and product names. Within each group, it calculates the following metrics:
        - `avg_price`: The average unit price for the products in each category and product combination.
        - `total_quantity_sold`: The total quantity of products sold in each category and product combination.
        - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated for each category and product combination, calculated as the sum of the product of `unit_price` and `quantity` for each order.
        4. $match Stage: The `$match` stage filters the results to include only those documents where `total_revenue` is greater than 10,000. This step effectively filters out 
        categories and products that haven't generated substantial revenue.
        5. $sort Stage: Finally, the `$sort` stage sorts the results in ascending order of `category_name` and descending order of `total_revenue`. This sorting helps in presenting
        the data in a meaningful and organized way, with the highest revenue categories listed first within each category group.

        The provided React code defines a functional component called `Counter` that implements a simple counter application. The core functionality 
        of this code can be broken down into the following steps:
        1. Initializing State= The component uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state variable `count` with an initial value of 0.
        2. Increment and Decrement Functions=
            - Two functions, `increment` and `decrement`, are defined within the component.
            - `increment` increases the `count` state by 1 when called.
            - `decrement` decreases the `count` state by 1 when called.
        3. Rendering:
        - In the render function, the component returns JSX that displays the following elements:
            - An `<h1>` element with the text "Counter".
            - A `<p>` element that displays the current value of `count`.
            - Two `<button>` elements labeled "Increment" and "Decrement."
            - Each button has an `onClick` event handler that calls either `increment` or `decrement` function when clicked.
        4. User Interface:
            - The user interacts with the application by clicking the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons.
            - Clicking "Increment" increases the displayed count by 1.
            - Clicking "Decrement" decreases the displayed count by 1.
        5. State Management:
                - The `count` state is managed by React. When `increment` or `decrement` is called, it updates the `count` state, which triggers a re-render of the component with the new value.
        6. Displaying Count:
                - The current value of `count` is displayed within the `<p>` element in the JSX.
        In summary, this React code creates a simple counter application with buttons to increment and decrement a counter value. It uses React's
        state management to keep track of the count and re-renders the component when the count changes, ensuring the UI reflects the current count 
        value.

        Business Logic Extracted from the Angular Code:
        1. Purpose:
        - The provided Angular code defines a `CounterComponent` that represents a simple counter with an initial count value of 0.
        - It offers the functionality to increment the count when a button is clicked.
        2. Key Algorithmic Steps:
        - Initialize the `count` variable to 0 when the `CounterComponent` is created.
        - Provide an HTML template that displays the current count and a button to increment it.
        - Implement the `incrementCount()` method that increases the `count` by 1 when the button is clicked.
        3. High-Level Logic:
        - Upon initialization, the counter starts at 0.
        - The template displays the current count, and when the "Increment" button is clicked, the count increases by 1.
        4. Code Comments (for clarification):
        - The Angular `@Component` decorator is used to define the component's metadata.
        - The `count` variable represents the current count value.
        - The `incrementCount()` method increases the count by 1 when called.
        - The HTML template displays the current count using interpolation: {{ count }}.
        - The button element has a click event binding that triggers the `incrementCount()` method when clicked.
        5. Business-Relevant Variables:
        - `count` (number): Represents the current count value in the business logic.
        Overall, this Angular component provides a straightforward counter feature, allowing users to see the current count and increment it with a button click.

        This Code is used to maintain customer master records. It allows displaying, editing, and adding customer records.
        The program starts by checking if any parameters were passed. If not, it closes the display file MTNCUSTD and ends.
        If parameters were passed, it determines if it should display, edit, or add a record based on the parameters. It then initializes 
        various fields, opens the display file if needed, and builds the function key text to display at the bottom of the screen.
        It then enters a loop to handle the requested function.
        For displaying a record, it reads the record from the database, fills the screen fields, protects all fields, displays the screen, 
        and ends the program.
        For editing a record, it reads the record, fills the screen, and enters a loop to handle screen I/O until the data is valid. It 
        allows updating fields like the active status, name, address, phone numbers, etc. If F12 is pressed, the program ends. If Enter 
        is pressed, it updates the database record. If F5 is pressed, it rereads the record in case it was changed by another user.
        For adding a record, it clears the record and screen fields, fills default values, and enters a loop to handle screen I/O until the 
        data is valid. It allows entering all fields to add a new record. If F12 is pressed, the program ends. If Enter is pressed, it adds 
        the new record to the database.
        The program uses various subprocedures to handle specific functions like building the function key text, clearing the screen, 
        protecting/unprotecting fields, handling screen I/O, editing specific fields, adding/updating records, etc.
        It uses a data structure called dfIndDS to keep track of indicators for the display file. It uses named constants for function keys 
        and other values. It has error handling using a subfile for messages and the SndSflMsg subprocedure.
        In summary, this RPG program allows basic maintenance of customer master records including displaying, editing, and adding records.

        The high-level business logic of the provided SAS code involves visually representing and analyzing data in the form of a bar chart.
        The data preparation step involves reading in data with two variables: "category" and "count." The "category" variable contains categorical 
        values (in this case, likely words or labels like A, B, C, D), while the "count" variable contains numeric values associated with each category.
        The main objective of the code is to create a vertical bar chart where these categorical values (words or labels) are displayed on the x-axis, 
        and the numeric values (counts) are represented as the heights of the bars on the y-axis. This visual representation allows business users to
        quickly and intuitively compare and analyze the distribution of counts across different categories, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
        In summary, the code's business logic involves transforming data with word-based categories and their corresponding numeric values into a visual
        format (bar chart) to facilitate the easy interpretation and analysis of the data's distribution by business stakeholders.

       The provided DSPF (Display File) code defines a display interface for capturing a user's name and displaying a welcome message. 
       It initializes the display, defines a record format for data organization, prompts the user to enter their name, provides an 
       input field for name input, displays a welcome message that includes the user's name, and allows the user to exit the program
       by pressing PF03. This code's core business logic involves user interaction and data presentation, with the "NAME" variable 
       storing the user's input. The code uses DSPF-specific functions and parameters for display file configuration and interaction.
