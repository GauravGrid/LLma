            1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, to the start and end of the array.
            2. Enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right.
            3. Calculate the middle index mid of the current search range.
            4. Check if the element at index mid in the array is equal to the target:
            a. If it is equal, return mid as the result, indicating that the target is found.
            b. If it is not equal:
                i. If the element at index mid is less than the target, update left to mid + 1 to search in the right half of the current range.
                ii. If the element at index mid is greater than the target, update right to mid - 1 to search in the left half of the current range.
            5. If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1 as the result, indicating that the target is not in the array.

        1. Data Sources- The query retrieves data from three main tables: `products`, `order_items`, and `product_categories`. These tables likely represent products, individual sales transactions, and product categories, respectively.
        2. Product Metrics- For each product, the query calculates the average unit price (`avg_price`), total quantity sold (`total_quantity_sold`), and total revenue (`total_revenue`) generated from all sales.
        3. Grouping- The results are grouped by product category (`category_name`) and product name (`product_name`). This grouping allows us to see how products in each category are performing.
        4. Filtering (HAVING clause)- To focus on significant product performance, the query filters out products with total revenue less than or equal to $10,000. This helps identify products that are contributing substantially to revenue.
        5. Sorting (ORDER BY clause)- The final result set is sorted first by product category in ascending order (`pc.category_name`) and then by total revenue in descending order (`total_revenue DESC`). This arrangement provides a clear view of how products within each category rank in terms of revenue generation.
        Overall, this SQL code is designed to provide a meaningful analysis of product performance within different categories, highlighting top-performing products that have generated significant revenue, while also showing average pricing and quantity sold. This information can be valuable for strategic business decisions, inventory management, and marketing efforts.

    Business_Logic=
        The provided code appears to be an aggregation pipeline for querying and aggregating data from a MongoDB database, likely related to orders, products, and product categories.
        Here's a breakdown of the business logic behind this code:
        1. $lookup Stages (Joins): The code starts by performing two `$lookup` stages. These stages essentially perform left outer joins between the `orders` collection and 
        the `products` collection, as well as between the `products` collection and the `product_categories` collection. It links documents based on common fields 
        (`product_id` and `category_id`) to combine data from different collections into a single document.
        2. $unwind Stages: After the `$lookup` stages, the `$unwind` stages are used to deconstruct the arrays created by the `$lookup` operations. This is done to flatten the 
        arrays and work with individual documents for further processing.
        3. $group Stage: The `$group` stage groups the documents by a composite key, consisting of `category_name` from the `product_categories` collection and `product_name`
        from the `products` collection. This step effectively groups orders by product categories and product names. Within each group, it calculates the following metrics:
        - `avg_price`: The average unit price for the products in each category and product combination.
        - `total_quantity_sold`: The total quantity of products sold in each category and product combination.
        - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated for each category and product combination, calculated as the sum of the product of `unit_price` and `quantity` for each order.
        4. $match Stage: The `$match` stage filters the results to include only those documents where `total_revenue` is greater than 10,000. This step effectively filters out 
        categories and products that haven't generated substantial revenue.
        5. $sort Stage: Finally, the `$sort` stage sorts the results in ascending order of `category_name` and descending order of `total_revenue`. This sorting helps in presenting
        the data in a meaningful and organized way, with the highest revenue categories listed first within each category group.

react_example:
    User=
        import React, {{ useState }} from 'react';
        function Counter() {{
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        const increment = () => {{
            setCount(count + 1);
        }};
        const decrement = () => {{
            setCount(count - 1);
        }};
        return (
            <div>
            <h1>Counter</h1>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
            </div>
        );
        }}
        export default Counter;
    Business_Logic=
            The provided React code defines a functional component called `Counter` that implements a simple counter application. The core functionality 
            of this code can be broken down into the following steps:
            1. Initializing State= The component uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state variable `count` with an initial value of 0.
            2. Increment and Decrement Functions=
                - Two functions, `increment` and `decrement`, are defined within the component.
                - `increment` increases the `count` state by 1 when called.
                - `decrement` decreases the `count` state by 1 when called.
            3. Rendering:
            - In the render function, the component returns JSX that displays the following elements:
                - An `<h1>` element with the text "Counter".
                - A `<p>` element that displays the current value of `count`.
                - Two `<button>` elements labeled "Increment" and "Decrement."
                - Each button has an `onClick` event handler that calls either `increment` or `decrement` function when clicked.
            4. User Interface:
                - The user interacts with the application by clicking the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons.
                - Clicking "Increment" increases the displayed count by 1.
                - Clicking "Decrement" decreases the displayed count by 1.
            5. State Management:
                 - The `count` state is managed by React. When `increment` or `decrement` is called, it updates the `count` state, which triggers a re-render of the component with the new value.
            6. Displaying Count:
                 - The current value of `count` is displayed within the `<p>` element in the JSX.
            In summary, this React code creates a simple counter application with buttons to increment and decrement a counter value. It uses React's
            state management to keep track of the count and re-renders the component when the count changes, ensuring the UI reflects the current count 
            value.

    Business_Logic=
        This piece of code declares two constants, MAX_ELEMS and default_city_name, and then displays their values on
        some kind of output screen or device.MAX_ELEMS is declared to have a value of 100, which means it cannot be changed by the
        program. This constant could be used to limit the number of elements in an array or other data structure.default_city_name
        is declared to have a value of 'London'. This constant could be used to set a default value for a variable or parameter
        that represents a city name.The dsply statements are used to display the values of these constants to the user. This could
        be useful for testing or debugging purposes.Finally, the return statement indicates the end of the program.In summary, this
        code sets up two constants and displays their values, which could be useful for setting default values or limiting the
        size of data structures.
