        1. Initialize left to 0 and right to the length of the array minus one.
        2. Repeat the following steps while left is less than or equal to right:
            i. Calculate mid as the average of left and right.
            ii. If the element at mid is equal to the target, return mid.
            iii. If the element at mid is less than the target, update left to mid + 1.
            iv. Otherwise, update right to mid - 1.
        3. If the loop exits without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the element is not in the array.      
    Python Code=
       def binary_search(arr, target):
            left = 0
            right = len(arr) - 1

        1.Initialize variables to keep track of the current starting point (start), total petrol surplus/deficit (totalPetrol), and current
            petrol surplus/deficit (currentPetrol).
        2.Loop through each petrol pump in the circular route, calculating the surplus/deficit of petrol at each pump and updating the 
        variables accordingly.
        3.If at any point during the loop, currentPetrol becomes negative, reset it to zero and update the start index to the next pump.
        4.After processing all petrol pumps, check if the totalPetrol is greater than or equal to zero. If it is, return the start index as
        the starting point where the car can complete the circular route. If totalPetrol is negative, return -1, indicating that there is
        no valid starting point.

        1. Data Sources- The query retrieves data from three main tables: `products`, `order_items`, and `product_categories`. These tables likely represent products, individual sales transactions, and product categories, respectively.
        2. Product Metrics- For each product, the query calculates the average unit price (`avg_price`), total quantity sold (`total_quantity_sold`), and total revenue (`total_revenue`) generated from all sales.
        3. Grouping- The results are grouped by product category (`category_name`) and product name (`product_name`). This grouping allows us to see how products in each category are performing.
        4. Filtering (HAVING clause)- To focus on significant product performance, the query filters out products with total revenue less than or equal to $10,000. This helps identify products that are contributing substantially to revenue.
        5. Sorting (ORDER BY clause)- The final result set is sorted first by product category in ascending order (`pc.category_name`) and then by total revenue in descending order (`total_revenue DESC`). This arrangement provides a clear view of how products within each category rank in terms of revenue generation.
        Overall, this SQL code is designed to provide a meaningful analysis of product performance within different categories, highlighting top-performing products that have generated significant revenue, while also showing average pricing and quantity sold. This information can be valuable for strategic business decisions, inventory management, and marketing efforts.

        The provided code appears to be an aggregation pipeline for querying and aggregating data from a MongoDB database, likely related to orders, products, and product categories.
        Here's a breakdown of the business logic behind this code:
        1. $lookup Stages (Joins): The code starts by performing two `$lookup` stages. These stages essentially perform left outer joins between the `orders` collection and 
        the `products` collection, as well as between the `products` collection and the `product_categories` collection. It links documents based on common fields 
        (`product_id` and `category_id`) to combine data from different collections into a single document.
        2. $unwind Stages: After the `$lookup` stages, the `$unwind` stages are used to deconstruct the arrays created by the `$lookup` operations. This is done to flatten the 
        arrays and work with individual documents for further processing.
        3. $group Stage: The `$group` stage groups the documents by a composite key, consisting of `category_name` from the `product_categories` collection and `product_name`
        from the `products` collection. This step effectively groups orders by product categories and product names. Within each group, it calculates the following metrics:
        - `avg_price`: The average unit price for the products in each category and product combination.
        - `total_quantity_sold`: The total quantity of products sold in each category and product combination.
        - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated for each category and product combination, calculated as the sum of the product of `unit_price` and `quantity` for each order.
        4. $match Stage: The `$match` stage filters the results to include only those documents where `total_revenue` is greater than 10,000. This step effectively filters out 
        categories and products that haven't generated substantial revenue.
        5. $sort Stage: Finally, the `$sort` stage sorts the results in ascending order of `category_name` and descending order of `total_revenue`. This sorting helps in presenting
        the data in a meaningful and organized way, with the highest revenue categories listed first within each category group.
        In summary, this code is intended to retrieve and aggregate data from multiple MongoDB collections to provide insights into product sales and revenues. It identifies product 
        categories and products that have generated significant revenue, presenting the results in a sorted manner for further analysis or reporting.

        The provided React code defines a functional component called `Counter` that implements a simple counter application. The core functionality 
        of this code can be broken down into the following steps:
        1. Initializing State= The component uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state variable `count` with an initial value of 0.
        2. Increment and Decrement Functions=
            - Two functions, `increment` and `decrement`, are defined within the component.
            - `increment` increases the `count` state by 1 when called.
            - `decrement` decreases the `count` state by 1 when called.
        3. Rendering:
        - In the render function, the component returns JSX that displays the following elements:
            - An `<h1>` element with the text "Counter".
            - A `<p>` element that displays the current value of `count`.
            - Two `<button>` elements labeled "Increment" and "Decrement."
            - Each button has an `onClick` event handler that calls either `increment` or `decrement` function when clicked.
        4. User Interface:
            - The user interacts with the application by clicking the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons.
            - Clicking "Increment" increases the displayed count by 1.
            - Clicking "Decrement" decreases the displayed count by 1.
        5. State Management:
                - The `count` state is managed by React. When `increment` or `decrement` is called, it updates the `count` state, which triggers a re-render of the component with the new value.
        6. Displaying Count:
                - The current value of `count` is displayed within the `<p>` element in the JSX.
        In summary, this React code creates a simple counter application with buttons to increment and decrement a counter value. It uses React's
        state management to keep track of the count and re-renders the component when the count changes, ensuring the UI reflects the current count 
        value.

        The above piece of code declares a data structure named families, which is qualified and has a dimension of 5. It contains three fields: address, numPeople, and people. The address field is a character field of length 50, while numPeople is an unsigned integer field of length 3. The people field is an array of 8 elements, each of which contains two fields: name and age.
        The dcl-s statement declares three variables: numFamilies, i, and j. numFamilies is an unsigned integer field of length 5, initialized to 0. i and j are both integer fields of length 10.
        The code then sets the address of the first family to '10 Mockingbird Lane', and sets the name and age of the first two people in the family. The numPeople field is also set to 2. The numFamilies variable is then set to 1.
        The code then enters a loop, iterating over each family in the families data structure. For each family, the address is displayed using the dsply statement. The code then enters a nested loop, iterating over each person in the family. For each person, the name and age are displayed using the dsply statement.
        Finally, the return statement is used to indicate the end of the program.
        In summary, this code declares a data structure and three variables, sets the values of the data structure and variables, and then displays the address and name/age of each person in each family. This could be useful for displaying information about a set of families and their members.
